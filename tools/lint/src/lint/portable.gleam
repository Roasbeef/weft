//// R6: the three packages held to the portable subset, and what that
//// membership protects.
////
//// `core`, `machine` and `prompt` contain no `@external` and reach for no
//// BEAM-only dependency. That has been true since they were written and
//// until now nothing said it had to be. Two properties rest on it, and one
//// external closes both:
////
//// - **The operation state space stays property-testable without
////   processes.** This is the reason `machine`'s package doc already gives
////   for its purity, and it is the right one: `next_action` is `State ×
////   Inputs → Action`, so a property test enumerates states instead of
////   spawning a supervision tree to observe them. Foreign code is trusted
////   unchecked — the annotation is the compiler's only evidence about what
////   is on the other side — so an external is a hole in exactly the claim
////   those tests rest on, however deterministic the function behind it is.
//// - **The three stay compilable to the JavaScript target.** The durable
////   model, the whole operation machine and prompt assembly are portable
////   today. That is enough to *decide but not act*: replay a conversation
////   tree, validate a transcript with the same total decoders the server
////   uses, run `next_action` over fetched state to show what the harness
////   would do next. Every effect still proxied through the broker.
////
//// The second property is the one nothing recorded, and it is the one a
//// contributor cannot be expected to infer. Reaching for a fast hash, a
//// clock or a UUID leaves the testability argument feeling satisfied — the
//// function is deterministic and side-effect-free — while closing a door
//// nobody knew was open.
////
//// # What portable does not mean
////
//// Not that the harness could run in a browser, and the rule should not be
//// read as a step toward it. `gleam_otp` has no JavaScript target and the
//// orchestration plane *is* supervision trees, actors, monitors and links;
//// there is nothing to port the design onto. Rule Zero is kernel-enforced —
//// bwrap namespaces, Landlock, seccomp, a helper over a port — and in a
//// browser the harness VM and the untrusted-code VM would be the same VM,
//// which inverts the invariant the whole architecture exists to hold. The
//// two-channel doctrine assumes both channels, and doorbells need
//// processes. The short path to a browser client is not porting the harness
//// at all: it is `packages/tui`'s seam, the frozen §1.6 protocol over the
//// client gateway, which gets the real harness and its real sandbox behind
//// a web front end.
////
//// # Why `@external` at all, and not `@external(erlang`
////
//// Because no target is the safe one. An Erlang external closes the
//// portable half. A JavaScript external keeps it and breaks the BEAM build
//// instead, which is the target Loom actually ships on. A matched pair
//// keeps both builds and still puts trusted-unchecked foreign code inside
//// the three packages whose entire claim is that they are pure functions of
//// their arguments. The rule therefore names no target: this is the strict
//// form of the FFI confinement rule (gleam-style Part IV §4), which already
//// confines `@external` to `*/internal/ffi_*.gleam` everywhere. These three
//// have no such module and may not grow one.
////
//// # Where each half looks
////
//// The `@external` half reads the **token stream** (`lint/source`), not the
//// AST: a policy rule must still report an external in a file `glance`
//// could not parse, rather than let it become an R0 warning. The
//// BEAM-only-import half reads the AST, where a module path is one string
//// and there is nothing a lexer would see more of. The `gleam.toml` half is
//// a **line scan**, not a parse: the question is only whether a dependency
//// name appears as a key, and a TOML parser would be a dependency bought
//// for three lines. That scan deliberately does not tell `[dependencies]`
//// from `[dev_dependencies]` — a BEAM-only dev dependency makes the
//// package's own test suite unrunnable on the other target, which is where
//// a lapsed property would first be noticed.

// are known by *name*: someone hand-curated the table. The
// `or_fault → or_fail → or_outcome → or_reply → or_continue` lineage
// (gleam-style Part III, "Short-circuit combinators") is the same hazard on
// roughly seventy locally-defined functions the table has never heard of —
// and the style guide now actively recommends writing more of them. This
// finds them by *signature* instead: the house pattern is "the fallible
// subject first, the continuation last" (verbatim from the guide), so a
// function whose last parameter is `fn(…)` and whose other parameters are
// not is `use`-compatible the same way `bool.guard` is, whoever wrote it.
//
// The subject at position 0 is deliberately left alone — it is meant to be
// computed unconditionally (`or_fault(plan_batch(…), then)`'s subject is
// real work, not a discarded fallback) — so only the parameters *between*
// the subject and the continuation are eager in R1's sense. A two-parameter
// combinator (`or_fault`, `or_halt`, `or_key_halt`: just a subject and a
// continuation) contributes nothing to check, which is why this rule adds
// findings without flooding the report across the whole lineage.
//
// The signature alone is not enough, and the first census proved it: nine
// of R1's thirty-three findings were parameters that merely *sat* between
// the subject and the continuation and were used unconditionally by the
// callee — `session.read_cell`'s `key:` goes straight into the register
// read, `claimed_effect`'s `key:` drives the claim check itself. Nothing
// about those is a discarded fallback (issue #73, C).
//
// So the body is read as well as the signature, and the question asked of
// it is the one the rule actually means: **does this combinator branch on
// its subject, and is the parameter outside that branch?** The decision is
// the subject of a leading `case` or the first argument of a leading `use
// <- guard(…)`; a combinator that branches on nothing, or on something
// other than its own first parameter, is not the shape this rule knows and
// contributes nothing. A parameter named in the decision is not a fallback:
// the combinator has already used it by the time it chooses, so evaluating
// it eagerly costs nothing that was not going to be spent.
//
// Both halves of that are decidable without types — a name appears in an
// expression or it does not — and both are conservative in the same
// direction: an unrecognized body shape drops the rows rather than
// inventing them. What is left is still not a proof that the argument is
// wasted (a `case` arm that ignores the continuation may use the parameter
// anyway), so the rule keeps reporting rather than gating, and stays a
// warning.

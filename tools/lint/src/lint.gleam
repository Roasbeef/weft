//// Loom's own lint: the house rules `gleam check` and `gleam format` do not
//// know about.
////
//// # Why this exists
////
//// Gleam ships no lint command. `gleam check` is a typechecker and
//// `gleam format` is a layout tool; neither has an opinion about whether an
//// eagerly-evaluated fallback is expensive, how deep a `case` may nest, or
//// whether `panic` belongs in `src/`. Those rules were enforced by review
//// alone until a repo-wide de-nesting wave violated one of them and shipped
//// a quadratic JSON parser whose every unit test passed (`08cdbce`). R1 is
//// the rule that would have caught it, and R5 is the rule that would have
//// caught the other half of the same bug.
////
//// # Staging
////
//// A rule ships at **warning** level until its census argues it onto the
//// error tier: zero findings, decidable without types, and a reason
//// promotion protects something. A lint that fails correct code gets
//// disabled, so the false-positive rate on this corpus is a thing to
//// measure before gating on it — the same staging `scripts/doc_check.sh`
//// went through, and for the same reason
//// (docs/design-notes/four-decisions.md, D2). R0, R2, R4 and R6 have made
//// that argument and gate; R1 and R5 have a census to clear first; R3
//// over-reports by construction and warns forever. The decision is data,
//// in `finding.error_by_default`, which is where each argument is written
//// down; `lint/cli`'s `--error` promotes one for a single run.
////
//// # Totality
////
//// `lint` is total *given `glance` returns*. Every input maps to a list of
//// findings: a file that will not parse is one `R0` finding, never a crash,
//// and an expression the walker does not model contributes nothing rather
//// than an error. The one residual is inside the parser itself — `glance`
//// carries hard `panic`s ("parser bug, expression not full reduced") on
//// paths no fuzzing has reached. If some input ever reaches one, the panic
//// propagates out of `glance.module` and crashes the linter. This is the
//// same claim `codemode/vet` makes about the same parser, and it is no
//// stronger.
////
//// This module does no I/O; `lint/cli` reads files and prints.

/// one resolve to. Given only its own file, the rule saw only the calls
/// that happened to sit beside the definition: sixteen of `tool.or_outcome`'s
/// nineteen call sites are elsewhere (issue #73, D). `lint/cli` collects
/// `exported_combinators` over every source it is about to lint and passes
/// the whole table to each one, which is the only reason this is two
/// functions rather than one.
///
/// A single-file caller — a test, a doctest snippet — passes `[]` and gets
